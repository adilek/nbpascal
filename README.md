NetBeans Pascal Module (outdated)

I worked on this module at Baku State University when I was student. Probably it was for course-project (I can't remember). 

Now the Schliemann engine is not actual for NetBeans. So this project also will not work. 

It can be helpful for students or researchers who learn about EBNF and their implementations using different tools. If I'll have free time, may be I'll convert it to java lexer. :)
